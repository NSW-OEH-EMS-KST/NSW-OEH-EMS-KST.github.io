## Grid Garage

**Grid Garage** is an ArcGIS python toolbox supporting table based processing.The toolbox is being developed under ArcGIS 10.4.0 

The **Grid Garage** python script tools grew over time to manage processing projects within the Knowledge Services Team of the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. The toolset is useful for managing and processing large amounts of spatial data (geodata), which may be in different formats and projections. The tools output tables reporting meta-detail of operations this allows easy chaining of results and failures into further processing operations as inputs.

The **Grid Garage** Toolbox is designed to help you undertake the Geographic Information System (GIS) tasks required to process GIS data (geodata) into a standard, spatially aligned format.  This format is required by most, grid or raster, spatial modelling tools such as the [Multi-criteria Analysis Shell for Spatial Decision Support (MCAS-S)](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/multi-criteria-analysis). Grid Garage contains 26 tools designed to save you time by batch processing repetitive GIS tasks as well diagnosing problems with data and capturing a record of processing step and any errors encountered.

Grid Garage provides tools that function using a list based approach to batch processing where both inputs and outputs are specified in tables to enable selective batch processing and detailed result reporting. In many cases the tools simply extend the functionality of standard ArcGIS tools, providing some or all of the inputs required by these tools via the input table to enable batch processing on a 'per item' basis. This approach differs slightly from normal batch processing in ArcGIS, instead of manually selecting single items or a folder on which to apply a tool or model you provide a table listing target datasets. In summary the
Grid Garage allows you to:

* List, describe and manage very large volumes of geodata.
* Batch process repetitive GIS tasks such as managing (renaming, describing etc.) or processing (clipping, resampling, reprojecting etc.) many geodata inputs such as time-series geodata derived from satellite imagery or climate models.
* Record any errors when batch processing and diagnose errors by interrogating the input geodata that failed.
* Develop your own models in ArcGIS ModelBuilder that allow you to automate any GIS workflow utilising one or more of the Grid Garage tools that can process an unlimited number of inputs.

The Grid Garage is intended for use by anyone with an understanding of GIS principles and an intermediate to advanced level of GIS skills.  Using the Grid Garage tools in ArcGIS ModelBuilder requires skills in the use of the ArcGIS ModelBuilder tool.

## KST Custom Tools

**KST Custom Tools** is a python toolbox with a few custom ArcGIS tools developed by the NSW OEH Ecosystem Management Science Knowledge Services Team.

These tools address analysis situations where there is no easy or obvious workflow within ArcGIS was available.

The tools can be downloaded here: 
[KST Custom Tools Releases](https://github.com/NSW-OEH-EMS-KST/kst-custom-tools/releases)


## Aboriginal Site Decision Support Tools (ASDST)

The **ASDST** tools are for in-house work on projects affecting Aboriginal sites. The tools require access to specific datasets.

Releases can be found here: [ASDST Releases](https://github.com/NSW-OEH-EMS-KST/asdst/releases)
